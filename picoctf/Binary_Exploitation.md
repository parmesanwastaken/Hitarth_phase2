# 1. buffer overflow 0

> Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution:

- I installed both files and decided the `cat` the source code
- It called a `flag.txt` and made use of various functions, including `gets` and `fgets`
- The hint mentioned to check `man` page of `gets`, so I did that and figured it has memory issues and easily gets overflowed
- Checked the source code more properly and saw `buf1` had 100 limit
- The `input` didn't have any limit, so I decided to just smash my keyboard and enter lot of characters

```
Input: fgdfkngdkfngkjdfngkjdfngkdjnfgdkfjgkdjfngkdjnfgkjdnfgjdkfjngkdjfngkdfgkdfkgjndfkgndfgjndkfjngkdfngkdfkgjdfjngkdjfgkjdnfgndkfjngkdjnfkgjndfjngkdjnfgkjndfjngdkfngdjfgkdfngkdjfnkgjdnfkgjndfkgjndkfngdkjfngkdnfgjndfgjnfjndslsf
```
- This printed the flag

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt a bit about how stack and buffer overflow work

## Notes:

- Went through attatched videos and website in Phase 2 PDF, but none of them made any sense ;-;
- Simply reading source code did help a lot tho, and thus I was able to get the flag

# 2. format string 0

## Solution:

```bash
Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation: Gr%114d_Cheese
Gr                                                                                                           4202954_Cheese
Good job! Patrick is happy! Now can you serve the second customer?
Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop (better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)
Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
Enter your recommendation: Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
ClaCla%sic_Che%s%steakic_Che(null)
```
- First I used `cat` to check the source code of file and read a bit through it
- Now I had idea that I will have to choose 2 orders and understand the source code to exploit these and get the flag
- At first I read Patrick part and realised if I choose wrong string then I am asked to give something else cause he is still hungry.
- So I decided to give him the largest option, which was `Gr%114d_Cheese` cause of `%114d` which infaltes the character amount.
- Now that this was done, I was asked to give order to Sponge Bob
- The options `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` has lot of `%s` with no input for it, which lead to program getting crashed
- Thus it printed the flag

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_a1d85b3e}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt how different functions and syntaxes in C can be exploited to act differently and thus take advantage of program to give output it isn't supposed to

## Notes:

- At first I got confused what to choose when I was given options, but inspecting source code helped me!

## Resources:

- Few searches regarding how some syntaxes work

# 3. clutter-overflow

> Clutter, clutter everywhere and not a byte to use. `nc mars.picoctf.net 31890`

## Solution:

- 

```
put codes & terminal outputs here using triple backticks

you may also use ```python for python codes for example
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{}
```
