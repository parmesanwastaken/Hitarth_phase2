# 1. Cookies

> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

## Solution:

- First opened the website and looked around a bit.
- The title made it pretty obvi that I had to mess with cookies
- I opened dev panel > storage > cookies
- Now that I can see cookie values, I decided to put `snickerdoodle` as first input, which was hinted on the input box itself
- This switched cookie value from `-1` to `0` and prompted that this is a valid cookie but not special one
- So I decided to enter random numbers, first I changed cookie value to `999`, this wasn't valid so I decided to switch it to `100`, which was't valid either
- Kept cutting down, until I realised max valid value was `28`, but that didn't have anything useful either.
- So I went chronologically from `0`
- Finally the value `18` gave me the valid flag

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt how to mess with cookies and change its value and thus exploit unsecure cookies on websites.

## Notes:

- I tried some random strings such as `admin` when I realised `28` was last valid cookie and still didn't give anything.

## Resources:

- None
